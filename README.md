Coder Academy 1st semester terminal app project in Ruby

TV Show Organisor (TVSO)

Description:
TVSO is a terminal app that allows you to view and manage your progress through your favourite TV shows.

Purpose:
Have you ever felt the pain of coming back to a show from a long hiatus (maybe due to being a good student and swapping Game of Thrones for your History text book so you can ace your final exam) and not remembering where you left off? Have you spent 20 minutes watching an episode, only to realise you've already seen it? How did that make you feel? If you're anything like me, you might have given up on watching that series all together rather than dig through episode by episode to try and find the right place to pick up again.

Well not anymore, now with TVSO you can easily keep track of all your favourite shows from one easy to use location. Simply load up TVSO, add the details of a show you want to track, and mark off each episode as you watch it.

Never waste your time unintentionally rewatching shows again.
